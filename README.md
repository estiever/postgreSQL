# postgreSQL
Final Project for CSU-Global Campus' "Data Analytics for Enterprise Environments" course, which is a graduate level course.

The SQL code that I wrote was written in postgreSQL's pgAdmin4 web browser interface to create dimension tables and a fact table for a data warehouse for the Northwind Trading Company, which was created by Microsoft many years ago.  All code is 100% my own. I also wrote code for the ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) process to populate the dimension and fact tables.

After reading Ralph Kimball's "The Data Warehouse Toolkit," I wrote the attached paper and SQL code.
